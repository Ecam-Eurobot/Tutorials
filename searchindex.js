The concepts behind ROSserial are explored in detail in the chapter \"Software\" of this document. I personally recommend reading that section to better understand the code presented here. The three main actions of the Arduino board are: Separate dirty balls from clean balls (without colour detection and pusher in qualifying stages) Push bee Drive DC motor to shoot clean balls into home tank. These actions are activated and controlled fully by the ROS board. That is, if the ROS board wants to push the bee, the Arduino board must be ready to receive the message and activate the right actuators in order to push the bee. ! Attention: It is imperative to program the dynamixels to the right baudrate first! This can be done using the USB2Dynamixel and Dynamixel Wizard software as explained earlier. We had problems controlling the dynamixels via the ROS board at the default baudrate of 1000000 BPS.

DO NOT PUT SERIAL.BEGIN IN SETUP when you want to work with the dynamixels on an Arduino Uno.

We used the one provided directly by the arduino IDE in an object that we implemented : SPIManager how to work with SPIManager object will be illustrated at least code use for Cortex's engines control (Eurobot 2018) : MotorBroker 1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The SPIManager object must be seen as a communication channel with the slave. It will be necessary to instantiate one SPIManager object by slave. When creating the object, use the number of the SS pin as an argument. //Define the SS pin for each slave\n#define FL_SS 9\n#define FR_SS 2\n#define BL_SS 10\n#define BR_SS 3 //Object Instantiation\nSPIManager connFL(FL_SS);\nSPIManager connFR(FR_SS);\nSPIManager connBL(BL_SS);\nSPIManager connBR(BR_SS); Use the initialize() method to activate the communication channel. This call should be placed in the setup() function of the arduino code. connFL.initialize(); 2. Write data to a Slave's register as said above, to write a value in a register of the slave will first send the address of the register, then the size in number of byte and to finish, the message.

Read data from a Slave's register There are two functions to read some data: the first, readLongData , will return a value of type long and the other , readData , a value of type float32 below, an example of use where we get some data from th register 81 (0x51). encoders_msg.rear_left = connBL.readLongData(0x51);","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Our Master","id":"electronics/communication/spi.html#our-master","title":"Our Master"},"electronics/communication/spi.html#our-slaves":{"body":"When using the Arduino IDE to program atmeg328p, the slave mode is not available. Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() : change the two registers cited above and declaring the MISO pin as an output. reset() : reset private object variables. com() : manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. and some properties : command : return the register address. dataSize : return the size of the incoming message. msg : return the message (maximum 64 bits). endtrans : boolean that returns true if communication is complete. 1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The MOSI, MISO and SLK pin are always the same on arduino. If you want you can change the SS pin number we agree to use pin 10 as pin SS for the slave. Note : SS is a reserved name used for the SPI communication. On the begin of our script we create a SPI object and define the SS pin number as it's done in the following code : SpiSlave mySPI; //SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 to enable the communication, use the begin() method of the SPISlave object in the setup() function of the atemega : void setup()\n{ mySPI.begin();\n} 2. Interruption An incoming call performed by the master to the slave triggers an interrupt. In most cases, the method in which the interrupt routine will be placed will be: ISR (name _of _a _register) . in our case the register will be SPI _VTC _vect . As we work whith an atemega328p the shift register is called : SPDR . This way of working is illustrated in the following code : //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { //manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. mySPI.com(SPDR); //Method containing the registers of the Slave. spiReg(); } 3. Registers A SWITCH is commonly used to define the registers. In our case of use, it is the command property of the SPISlave object which is used as parameter of the SWITCH . the writing in a register will be done once the communication is finished (thanks to the property endTrans ). This method of work has the advantage of not having inconsistent values during the communication. The reading of a registers uses the full-duplex channel provided by the SPI. The data are pushed through the channel during the communication using the SPDR register. Here is an example of a function that contains the registers of a slave: void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } }","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Our Slaves","id":"electronics/communication/spi.html#our-slaves","title":"Our Slaves"},"electronics/communication/spi.html#quick-theoretical-reminders":{"body":"The Serial Peripheral Interface bus (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short distance communication, primarily in embedded systems.

That was OK, because we didn’t care about such output glitches caused by the input signals propagating to the outputs. From a demonstrator’s point of view it even made it more interesting. Talking to a real device, such as a SPI master is different, because it requires the outputs to be stable at certain times. z The solution is to introduce a clock signal, and store the signals in a flip-flop (registers) at the rising edge of that clock signal.

However, in this tutorial, we will use the arduino UNO to slightly simplify manipulation. Regarding the regulation, the following code implements the PID regulator. Its parameters were found after experimentation. It depends on the motor and the load. We simply adjusted the parameters until the motor behaviour was the expected one. (mr. Marchand knows the methodology ;) ) The blocks of the system are described below : Encoder The encoder sends the rotation information to the controller.

There are 4 pins on this sensor : TRIG, ECHO, VCC and GND (as you can see on the picture below). img It contains a transmitter and a receiver. The distance measure is pretty simple. Firstly, you have to send a signal on the TRIG pin so the sonar emits a wave of 8 pulses at 40kHz. Then the ECHO pin is set to the «HIGH» level until the emitted signal goes to the obstacle and comes back to the sensor (as you can see on the following picture). img Of course, you have to connect the sensor to a microcontroller. You can connect the VCC to the 5V pin of your board, the GND to the ground pin and the TRIG and ECHO to digital pins of your controller as illustrated on the picture below. img Finally it is also important to know that the measuring angle with the HC-SR04 sonar is 30 degrees.

So I choose a more powerfull and a better speed motor as a Maxon motor found in the lab and the results were very conclusive. alt text The next step was to control the speed of the wheel so we could control the distance the ball make after throwing by the ball gun. I used a small motor driver as the L293D which the specifications were in agreement with the needs of the DC motor. alt text alt text You can find the datasheet of the L293D here : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials/tree/StevenGaro-patch-1/src/mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC To control the H bridge driver, I used a simple arduino uno with a PWM signal so we could test different speeds of the motor. alt text The precision of the distance the ball make was made experimentaly when we did the different tests. The code I first used to test the driver with the motor is the next code in arduino : int inputPin = A0; // set input pin for the potentiometer\nint inputValue = 0; // potentiometer input variable const int motorPin1 = 5; // Pin 14 of L293\nconst int motorPin2 = 6; // Pin 10 of L293 void setup() { // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT: pinMode(motorPin1, OUTPUT); } void loop() { // read the value from the potentiometer: inputValue = analogRead(inputPin); // send the square wave signal to the LED: analogWrite(motorPin1, inputValue); digitalWrite(motorPin1, HIGH); delayMicroseconds(inputValue); // Approximately 10% duty cycle @ 1KHz digitalWrite(motorPin1, LOW); delayMicroseconds(1023 - inputValue); } When the tests were conclusive enough, we designed a ramp that fit in the robot correctly with an adjustable ramp for the ball to go higher or lower in case we need to modify the distance during the competition. First we made the fixed ramp that comes from the ball sorting mecanism and end around the wheel. alt text After that we made a straight ramp that shows the ball the direction it must take. alt text And finaly, we designed a small piece that maintain the straight ramp from below and that you can adjust. alt text After that, all we had to do is to install the gun in the robot and make some tests to determine the best power to give as a PWM to the motor to throw the balls from the distance chosen in the tank and to incorporate the code of the ball gun in the main code of the robot.","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » Construction step by step","id":"mechanical/2018/balls.html#construction-step-by-step","title":"Construction step by step"},"mechanical/2018/balls.html#introduction":{"body":"Initially, after much thought, we created a system composed of 3 basic parts and a colour detector. There are two parts that are mobile parts and one stagnant outer case. The system is divided into 4 compartments: the entry point, the colour sensor (CS) compartment, green trap compartment and the orange trap compartment. The colour detector is embedded in the stagnant outer case. Underneath the outer case is a moving plate controlled by an actuator (the dynamixel AX-12A) and a rotating \"pusher\" controlled by a stepper motor to move balls within the outer case. Essentially there are 4 main steps for a ball to be separated in this system: The ball enters the mechanism at the entry point. The stepper motor activates and moves the ball to the CS compartment. The colour sensor detects the colour of the ball. Once the colour of the ball is known, the dynamixel AX-12A is activated and the opening of the mobile plate is moved into the corresponding colour position. The stepper motor activates and moves the ball into the green trap or orange trap. The interest behind this idea is the fact that as the \"pusher\" is activated and moving another ball can enter at at the entry point and therefore creating a chain effect which we hoped would gain us time.","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » Introduction","id":"mechanical/2018/balls.html#introduction","title":"Introduction"},"mechanical/2018/balls.html#the-cortex-small-robot":{"body":"alt text This year, the Eurobot task was water purification.

Once the block is on the right floor, it has to be pushed outside of the lift to already be placed in its position on the tower on a kind of shelf (as you can see in the picture below) which supports the blocks even if there is no other block below. img Furthermore, to push the block, we use a dynamixel with a gear and a tooth rack to slide a plate along which pushes the block until it reaches the « shelf ». img Then the lift (without any block inside) goes down. To make sure it doesn’t go too much we use another limit switch. Therefore the lift is immediately stopped, another cube comes in and we can do the cube lifting steps mentioned before over again until all the cubes of the tower are placed. As mentioned above, we are using DC motors to control our lift. We have in all 3 motors and they are all connected to a L298 driver (see picture below) controlled by an Arduino Uno board. Here is a link where you can buy the driver : https://www.amazon.fr/L298-Motor-Driver/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AL298%20Motor%20Driver img We use 2 motors for the rollers to collect the blocks. In order to do so, each one has to turn in the opposite direction of the other but at the same speed. Thus we connected them to the same driver but inverted the pins of one motor compared to the other one. These motors don’t have an encoder so their only 2 pins are connected to the driver. We also have the third motor to make the lift go up and down. As we said before, we use the encoder to know where we have to stop so there are pins of the motor connected to the Arduino board. On the other hand the motor is also connected to the driver so we can control its speed, stop it and launch it.","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » The lift","id":"mechanical/2018/bigRobot.html#the-lift","title":"The lift"},"mechanical/3d-print.html#a1-how-to-think-3d-printing":{"body":"Now that you know how to design in 3D and export your file to a slicer, we'll take you straight to the world of the 3D printing.

Each one of them have their advantages and their defaults. It's true that the ABS will have better mechanical resistance against wear and tear than PLA but you'll have to pay more attention at the temperature variation and the wrapping problems. That's only the top of the iceberg for the materials, if you're interested by knowing more about it, you can still find a lot on the web on divers site like: Primant3D . Another simple tip is to think about the way the fibers during the use of the pieces. As you can see on this piece, a Pelton wheel , at first the shaft and the wheel were design as in one piece. img After thought, as the shaft will have to oppose strength in the radial way, it's way more efficient to print it horizontaly than verticaly (where the layers would detache). For the wheel, it's the opposite. The spoons have to go against strength in the perpendicular way, so it had to be printed also horizontal, laying on the bed.

Receive driving instructions over ROS and translate them to signals to send to the motors 2. Send encoder data back over ROS so we can localize the robot on the map 3. Activate the mechanical arms that we installed for this year's challenge We also included some debugging functionalities to test the encoders using LEDs for example. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First of all, we have to include all the used libraries. This includes the ROS library to subscribe to ROS topic; the servo library is used to control the mechanical arms; a PID library will manage the PID control loop to drive in a straight line and turn around the center of our robot; and finally, various message types that will be used to transfer information over ROS. #include <FastPID.h>\n#include <Arduino.h>\n#include <Servo.h>\n#include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Float32.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h>\n#include <std_msgs/String.h>\n#include <geometry_msgs/Vector3.h> Once this is done, all our used pins and variables have to be declared and defined. We tried to keep the names as self-explanatory as possible. As such, #define c_LeftEncoderPinA 2 means that the first of the two outputs of the left wheel encoder is connected to pin 2 of the Arduino. c_RightMotorPwmPin will be mapped to the pin that will transmit the pulse-width modulated signal that will define the speed of the right motor. void setup() { Serial.begin(57600); // init ROS nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub_lin); nh.subscribe(sub_rot); nh.subscribe(sub_arm); nh.subscribe(sub_stop); nh.advertise(pub_encoder); nh.advertise(pub_feedback); pinMode(c_LeftEncoderPinA, INPUT); digitalWrite(c_LeftEncoderPinA, LOW); pinMode(c_LeftEncoderPinB, INPUT); digitalWrite(c_LeftEncoderPinB, LOW); attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(c_LeftEncoderPinA), HandleLeftMotorInterrupt, CHANGE); pinMode(c_RightEncoderPinA, INPUT); digitalWrite(c_RightEncoderPinA, LOW); pinMode(c_RightEncoderPinB, INPUT); digitalWrite(c_RightEncoderPinB, LOW); attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(c_RightEncoderPinA), HandleRightMotorInterrupt, CHANGE); attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(c_RightEncoderPinB), HandleRightMotorInterrupt, CHANGE); pinMode(c_LeftLedPin, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(c_LeftLedPin, LOW); pinMode(c_RightLedPin, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(c_RightLedPin, LOW); pinMode(c_LeftMotorPwmPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(c_LeftMotorDirPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(c_RightMotorPwmPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(c_RightMotorDirPin, OUTPUT); if(diff_PID.err()) { nh.logerror(\"There is a configuration error!\"); for (;;) {} } TCCR2B = TCCR2B & 0b11111000 | 0x01; right_arm.attach(c_RightServoPin); left_arm.attach(c_RightServoPin);\n} Several variables will contain specific parameters to fine tune the PID loop and others will be used to store useful information such as the number of ticks one encoder has traveled or the messages that will be send over ROS. After that, we will instanciate certain objects, provided to us by the libraries we included, so we can make use of them later. We now have to declare our callback functions that are executed every time nh.spinOnce() is called if a new message is received on a ROS topic. \"What?!\" I hear you say, \"We haven't even started ROS or even told it on which topics to listen!\". And you'd be right. But we have to declare those functions before we tell ROS what topics to subscribe to because in the same line we also have to point to those callback functions that we are declaring. This is done with a pointer which has to point to an already existing function. So that's why we have to declare the function before we initiate ROS. Pfew! So here we are declaring those functions. Those are lin_cb , rot_cb , arm_cb , and stop_cb , who respectively listen to the cmd_lin , cmd_rot , cmd_arm , and cmd_stop topics. Each of these functions do similar things: first, they expect some object in input. These objects are given to us by ROS and will contain the last message received on the topic. Inside the function we then \"unpack\" the values from those message objects by assigning their attributes to variables declared earlier. Next, we call an external function that will execute an bction based on what message was received on what topic. Those functions will be written later in the file. We now arrive at the infamous void setup() function provided by the Arduino. As you all certainly know, the Arduino will execute the code inside this function once right after every boot. In this section we will begin the serial communication needed to communicate over ROS (with a baud rate of 57600 to limit the latency of the channel), initiate ROS, actually subscribe to the topics declared earlier, declare all the in and outputs, as well as this peculiar line: TCCR2B = TCCR2B & 0b11111000 | 0x01; What this does is change the Arduino Mega's pwm frequency on pin 9 and 10 to 31.37255kHz instead of the default 490.20Hz. You can find various explanation on the Arduino forum, but the only official Arduino documentation page that somewhat explains this feature is this one . After this the only other function that is needed for our program to be compilable is void loop() . The code in this loop is actually nothing else than an infinite while(true) loop that the Arduino will keep running over and over again until the end of times. You can see this loop is much smaller than the previous one. void loop() { encoder_msg.x = _LeftEncoderTicks; encoder_msg.y = _RightEncoderTicks; pub_encoder.publish(&encoder_msg); nh.spinOnce();\n} This is pretty straightforward. We set the x and y attributes of the encoder_msg object (whose type is geometry_msgs/Vector3. The z attribute of that oject is not used because we are working on a 2D plane) to the number of ticks the left and right encoder have traveled respectfully. We then have to tell ROS to puplish encoder_msg on the encoder_ticks topic the next time nh.spinOnce() is executed, which happens right after. Optionally, we can also turn our LEDs on or off for debugging purposes here. We now come to the final section of our code, which is where we declare all the functions that actually tell the motors to turn a certain way or count the number of impulses each encoder is giving in real time. I won't explain the insides of all those functions here, as they could almost all use a seperate documentation on their own. The essensial thing here is that those functions are not too badly written and work well as they are. There should be no reason to modify them unless there is a change in harware.","breadcrumbs":"Robots » 2019 » Soja » Code » Main purposes","id":"robots/2019/soja/code/motors.html#main-purposes","title":"Main purposes"},"robots/2019/soja/code/move.html#move-package":{"body":"The move package as it is in the github repository is not quite functional yet. Its purpose was to have a sequence of actions to execute in order ie. dirve forward for 50cm, turn 90° counterclockwise, drive 20 cm forward and activate the arm. The first thing that we wanted to do is to determine a set of absolute positions to drive to instead of having to tell each action. After losing way too much time trying to understand ROS actions and how to convert a current and target position in the form of an odom message to a set of instructions to be executed by the robot, we came to realise it would be much, much easier to directly have a list of actions to execute. This is exactly what we ended implementing. Unfortunately for us the tournament was only a few days away and we still had many other problems to solve. All this led to some really rushed and unstable code that ended up saving our ass and managed to score just a few points (and even win one match!). That code has long been burned to the ground and will never be spoken of again. So after that, we were so embarrassed that we tried to rewrite the code a bit better. That code never got quite finished and it is the one that you can find here . The general idea is that we should listen on some topic for a start message, after wich we send the first command to execute. We then wait for a feedback from the arduino telling us when that command has been successfully executed. Once we receive that signal, we can safely send the next instruction.","breadcrumbs":"Robots » 2019 » Soja » Code » Move package","id":"robots/2019/soja/code/move.html#move-package","title":"Move package"},"robots/2019/soja/code/odom.html#rpiodomcpp":{"body":"This file is part of the odom package on the raspberry pi.

Only when all the sensors' readings are acceptable will the robot be able to move. This is necessary for the qualifications of the robot before it can even go on the battlefield. The way all this is done is pretty simple and works well. Let's analyse this program from the bottom up. The following lines just tells our program to execute the listener() function defined above. __name__ == '__main__': listener() Because we have 7 ultrasonic sensors each publishing on their own topic, we must subscribe to those 7 topics individually. In addition, we have to initialise the rospy node and spin it up. This is done respectively with the first and last line of the listener() function. We also subscribe to the run topic, which we use to make sure the robot doesn't move after the match time is over. def listener(): rospy.init_node('ultrasound', anonymous=True) rospy.Subscriber('run', String, stop_cb) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_1', Range, callback, 1) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_2', Range, callback, 2) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_3', Range, callback, 3) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_4', Range, callback, 4) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_5', Range, callback, 5) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_6', Range, callback, 6) rospy.Subscriber('ultrasound_7', Range, callback, 7) rospy.spin() When a message appears on one of the sensor's topic, it calls the same callback() function with one extra argument. That argument is there so we know which sensor is seeing the data that is being passed. This way we cam make sure that none of the sensors has an obstacle in front of it before we tell the robot it can move. The way it works is that we declared a list go_condition that contains all boolean values. Each value corresponds to one sensor and is set to True when the sensor is clear and to False if an obstacle is present. Only when each element of that list is True will it continuously send the \"start\" string to the cmd_stop topic. If that condition is not met, it will send a \"stop\" message on the same topic. On the Arduino's side, that topic is being listened to and a boolean variable is set which will prevent going into the next iteration of the PID regulation loop and set the motors speed to 0 instead (while staying in that control loop with all other variables unaffected). The effect of this is that when the obstacle is removed and the \"start\" string is the one bieng published again, the robot simply continues where it had left as if nothing happened. def callback(data, sensor_num): pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_stop', String, queue_size=10) if (data.range < 10 and data.range > data.min_range): go_condition[sensor_num] = False else: go_condition[sensor_num] = True if (all(go_condition) == True): pub.publish(\"start\") else: pub.publish(\"stop\") This other callback function is used to set the first entry in the go_condition list to false if the \"stop\" message has been received when the time is over. The effect of this is the same as if one of the ultrasonic sensors had an obstacle in front of it idefinitely, keeping the robot still until everything is reset. def stop_cb(msg): print(msg.data) if (msg.data == \"stop\"): go_condition[0] = False","breadcrumbs":"Robots » 2019 » Soja » Code » rpi/ultrasound.py","id":"robots/2019/soja/code/ultrasound_rpi.html#rpiultrasoundpy","title":"rpi/ultrasound.py"},"robots/2019/soja/improvements.html#development-process":{"body":"","breadcrumbs":"Robots » 2019 » Soja » Development process","id":"robots/2019/soja/improvements.html#development-process","title":"Development process"},"robots/2019/soja/improvements.html#git--github":{"body":"Git and especially github are magnificent tools when used correctly.

The first value (pixel) is linked with red frame, the second value (pixel) with yellow frame and the last value (pixel) with white frame. before positionName = [red frame value, yellow frame value, white frame value] Here is the different positions for each frame: xmin is the left side of the frame xmax is the right side par of the frame ymin is the top side of the frame ymax is the bottom side of the frame Procedure : Maintain your cursor where you want to place a side of the frame Take note of the position (pixel) Open a new tab ( ctrl+shift+t ) and run this command to change a side of a frame in the following code(color_detection.py) : nano color_detection.py Restart for another side of the frame then save the file ( ctrl+x ) Result : after Adjusting the range color We must adjust the color range (RBG) to define each color. Therefore, the programme will be able to identify differents colors in each frame in function of these RGB values. We represente each color range by a matrix : color_range = [blue value, green value, red value] As a reminder, an RGB color value is specified with RGB (red, green, blue). Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. Procedure : Maintain your cursor in the center of the cube Take note of the RGB color Open a new tab ( ctrl+shift+t ) and change the color range in the code (color_detection.py) nano color_detection.py Restart for another cube then save the file ( ctrl+x ) Result : z Automation We have also implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time.

Here, we have chosen a GoPro as a camera because it has an acceptable quality (780 pixel-HD) and it has also a Wi-Fi module for the remote control. Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame to obtain the color. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination. As a matter of conclusion, we send combination to the robot by ROS. z Bill of materials: One Raspberry Pi zero W One Wi-Fi GoPro (Hero+) One 5V battery Etcher (https://etcher.io/) to install an OS on the Raspberry Connections No pins required Setup Download last version Ubuntu mate (16.04) or an another distribution for the raspberry (see install ) Active WiFi and open terminal ( alt+ctrl+t ): Install ROS (see install ) Download this repo from github , unzip Tutorials-master.zip to open the main folder.

Here are the different types of std_msgs : http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs . You can also use different kind of messages. For instance the ultrasound sensors use : #include <sensor_msgs/Range.h> Then you have to start a ROS node (takes care of serial port communications, allows to create publishers and subscribers) with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; You can now create a message object that you will later fill with data and this is the message you will finally publish : std_msgs::String msg; where msg is the name of the object. And of course you can choose the type of the message depending on the type of the transferred message. Then you have to choose if you want to create a publisher, a subscriber or even both. To create a publisher : ros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &msg); This tells that we are going to be publishing a message of the type of the msg variable (with std_msgs::String type) on the topic «chatter». This lets the master tell any nodes listening on «chatter» that we are going to publish data on that topic. You can now add lines in the void setup() of the Arduino script. You first initialize the node : nh.initNode() Next, the following call connects to the master to publicize that the node will be publishing messages on the given topic : nh.advertise(chatter); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} To fill the message object with the data you just have to do this : msg.data = hello; where hello is the data you put in your message and hello must have the same type as the msg variable. You can then publish you message on the topic. To do so you can either publish it once or continually in the void loop() of your Arduino code like this : void loop()\n{ chatter.publish( &str_msg );\n} Finally you have to add a last line of code in the loop that will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time : nh.spinOnce(); Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test a «Hello World» example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World : /* * rosserial Publisher Example * Prints \"hello world!\" */\n// Use the following line if you have a Leonardo or MKR1000 //#define USE_USBCON #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/String.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; std_msgs::String str_msg;\nros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &str_msg); char hello[13] = \"hello world!\"; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} void loop()\n{ str_msg.data = hello; chatter.publish( &str_msg ); nh.spinOnce(); delay(1000);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » ROS and Arduino » Publisher","id":"software/ros/arduino/publisher.html#publisher","title":"Publisher"},"software/ros/arduino/publisher.html#test-on-a-raspberry":{"body":"To test it you first have to connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry.

As the type of the std_msg is «Empty», you have to include the following lines at the beginning of your Arduino code : #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> Here again, like the Arduino Publisher Tutorial code, you have to start a ROS node with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; Then you initiate the callback function where you have to specify the name of the callback (messageCb), the type of the message (std_msgs::Empty) and the name of the message (toggle_msg which contains the transferred message).

For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on. Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations. An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> NewPing library isn't included in the Ros installation so you have to install it separatly Installation of NewpPing librairy Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot: #define TRIGGER_PIN1 5\n#define ECHO_PIN1 4 You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect : #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this : NewPing sonar1(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously. Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it : sensor_msgs::Range range_msg; You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial : ros::Publisher pub_range1(\"ultrasound_1\", &range_msg); We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated : range_msg.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;\nrange_msg.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\";\nrange_msg.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake\nrange_msg.min_range = 0.0;\nrange_msg.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code. The most important and useful one specifies the distance to an obstacle : range_msg.range = tmp/100; We can then publish that information about the distance (you can again refer to the Arduino Publisher Tutorial for the publishing part) : pub_range1.publish(&range_msg); Here is the whole code for four ultrasound sensors based on the one presented in this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ Moreover the code below is available in the Github repo of Ecam Eurobot : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino Code to upload on the Arduino before launching rosserial : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> #define TRIGGER_PIN1 5 //sensor 1\n#define ECHO_PIN1 4 #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 // Maximum distance we want to ping NewPing sonar1(TRIGGER_PIN1, ECHO_PIN1, MAX_DISTANCE); // back us ros::NodeHandle nh; sensor_msgs::Range range_msg; ros::Publisher pub_range1(\"ultrasound_1\", &range_msg); char frameid[] = \"base_link\"; long duration; float tmp; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(pub_range1); range_msg.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_1\"; range_msg.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg.min_range = 0.0; range_msg.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; } long range_time; void loop()\n{ //publish the adc value every 50 milliseconds //since it takes that long for the sensor to stabilize if ( millis() >= range_time ){ tmp=sonar1.ping_cm(); range_msg.range = tmp/100; range_msg.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range1.publish(&range_msg_rear); range_time = millis() + 50; } nh.spinOnce();\n}","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Arduino&Sensor ROS code","id":"software/ros/rosserial.html#arduinosensor-ros-code","title":"Arduino&Sensor ROS code"},"software/ros/rosserial.html#ros-and-arduino":{"body":"","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » ROS and Arduino","id":"software/ros/rosserial.html#ros-and-arduino","title":"ROS and Arduino"},"software/ros/rosserial.html#rosserial-installation":{"body":"To install and use rosserial you have to run the terminal, first update apt-get which allows you to install packages : sudo apt-get update You can choose to install the packages one by one : First type : sudo apt-get install arduino Then after the first installation : sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial And then : sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino Or you can directly install all the packages with one command in the terminal : sudo apt-get install -y \\ arduino \\ ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino \\ ros-kinetic-rosserial For more information you can follow installation of ros on arduino","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Rosserial installation","id":"software/ros/rosserial.html#rosserial-installation","title":"Rosserial installation"},"software/ros/rosserial.html#rosserial-sonar-simple-test":{"body":"To test if you receive the messages published by the Arduino on the Rasperry Pi you have to do the following : To test it you first have to upload the code you can find at the end of this tutorial (which you can also find on the Github repo of the Ecam Eurobot : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino ). If you need further information and explanations for this code, you can refer to the Sonar Sensor Tutorial in the Electronics part. You can also use that tutorial for the wiring of the sonar on your Arduino. Of course you have to choose the pin numbers so they correspond to the ones declared in the code previously mentionned or you can directly change in the code the pin numbers yourself. Then you have to connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry. To do so you can simply connect them with the serial Arduino cable to the Raspberry USB port as shown on the figure below. img Image reference : http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Serial-Communication/ After that, you have to launch the terminal and execute the following commands : on a first window you type : roscore on another window : rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB0 is the usb port the Arduino is connected to so you’ll have to change the «USB0».
