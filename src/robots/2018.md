# 2018

For the year 2018, the actions robots must perform to earn points are:
* collect blocks of colors to form a turn.
* collect colored balls, sort them by color and send them to several destinations.
* push a bee to explode an inflatable balloon.
* press a button to turn on a screen.

To do so, we decided to design 2 robots, Cortex and Minus.

Cortex is responsible for collecting the balls and pushing the bee and for Minus, collect the blocks and press a button.

In this chapter, we will talk about the general structure of the 2 robots and how to start them.
