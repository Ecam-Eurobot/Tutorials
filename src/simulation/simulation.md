# Simulation 
 
## 1- Robot model 
Ros give us away to create  the 3D model of a robot or its parts,  to simulate  it , by means of the URDF files.Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format that describes a robot,its parts,..

### Contents :

- Mostly <link> and <joint> elements
- <link>: robot structure
- <joint>: connections and motion constraints
  
### Example of URDF file :

```xml
<robot name="example">
	<link name="link_1"  />
   	<link name="link_2"  />
   	<join name="join_1" type="..">
     	 <parent link="link_1"  />
      	 <child link="link_2"  />
      </joint>
</robot>

```

### Limitations of URDF

URDF has four limitation you should be aware of it:

##### 1.Robot descriptions cannot be changed
- Robot description read once from server.
- No standardized way to notify. 
- Risk of desynchronization. 

#### 2.Only tree structures (no loops)

-	Joint only have single parent and child
-	Only acyclic, directed graphs (or: trees) 
-	Real-world impact


#### 3.There is no sensor models ```<sensor></sensor> ```

- Sensor meta-data can't be incorporated directly
- Alternatives exist, but then the data is distributed
- Diminishes value of URDF

#### 4.Low reusability of URDFs

-	Only a single <robot> tag in URDF
-	 No support for import of remote files
-	 Composite scenes have to be merged manually
-	 No way to compose multiple URDFs

#### So what is the solution ?

The solution of   these problems can be XACRO (short for XML Macros)
-	Programmatic URDF generation
-	Templates
-	Parameters XACRO
-	Import macros from other files
-	Parameterize templates
-	Composite robots & scenes easier:
-	import macro from file
-	Invoke macro

#### XACRO - Needs

-	XACRO not directly compatible with URDF
-	Transformation needed with this command:
```
$ rosrun xacro xacro /path/to/robot.xacro > robot.urdf
```
- Checks for valid XACRO file (but is not identical to check_urdf)
XACRO example

```xml
<xacro:macro name="arm" params="parent arm_name">
   <link name="${arm_name}_link_1"  />
   <joint name="${arm_name}_joint_1" type="..">
      <parent link="${parent}"  />
      <child link='${arm_name}_link_1"  />
   </joint>
</xacro:macro>
```

To run robot model 2019
```
roslaunch robot_description display_soja.launch
```

## RVIZ

RVIZ  (ROS visualization) ss a tools of  3D visualization for displaying  sensor data and state information from ROS.
If you want to  visualize   current configuration on a virtual model of the robot or display sensor data  coming over ROS Topics including ultrasonic  distance measurements, sonar data, and more you need to use rviz.  


To start running rviz :
on a first window you type :
```
roscore
```
on another window :
```  
rviz rviz
```
For example to visualize odomotry

1- clone code gihub for repository ECAM - Eurobot 2019

2- run :
```
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
```
Make sure you use the use  arduino serial

3- Run :  
```
rosrun odom odom
```
4- launch rviz : 
```
rviz rviz
```

Visaulize the robot simulation  

Run : 
```
roslaunch robot_2019 soja.launch  viz:=true
```
## Map server

Ros offers this package to read map and offers it. but how map server works ?

He read image data then  converts color value to ternary occupancy values:
- Free (0)
- Occupied (100)
- Unknown (-1)

map_server is a ROS node that reads a map from disk and offers it via a ROS service.
The current implementation of the map_server converts color values in the map image data into ternary occupancy values: free (0), occupied (100), and unknown (-1). Future versions of this tool may use the values between 0 and 100 to communicate finer gradations of occupancy.
#### Usage

map_server <map.yaml>

#### Example
```
rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml
```
###### To run map Eurobot 2019 :
1- on a first window you type :
```
roscore
```
2- on another window :
```
rosrun map_server map_server maps  eurobot-map.yaml
```
3- on another window :
```
rviz rviz
```
or just one commande using launch file
```
roslaunch maps map_launch.launch
```
