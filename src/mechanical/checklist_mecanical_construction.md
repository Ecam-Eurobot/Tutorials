# Checklist for mecanical construction
## Here are the elements to consider when designing the robot mechanically
- Have an idea of the number of cards and their connections to each other.
  This way, the cards will be better placed and the size of the wiring will be better.
  Too long cables take up a lot of space in a small robot like ours.
- Do not make the robot structure in 3D print. It is not modular and therefore has
  to be repeated every year and not very solid. In addition, if you have to change
  an element in last minute, a print takes a lot of time.
  It is necessary to find a modular structure with holes to
  - Attach the cards (or other) easily
  - Fix the cards (or other) easily
  - Create a structure that can be easily adapted even at the last minute
- Separate the rolling base WITH cards and ultrasound from the rest of the robot.
  In this way, this functional base can be re-used from year to year.
  It is also a certainty that this part of the robot works and will not move.
  This way -> no surprises at the homologation on the day of the competition.
  Why not add the battery slot with?
- Another module that could be interesting is the "ceiling" with:
  - Start-up card (to say which side of the field the robot is on)
  - Emergency stop button
  - Support for enemy beacon
- Make a robot as big as the rules allow. If you want to make exotic forms think about  using the space available and also the positions of the ultrasounds.
- Do it well in advance if you want to create a new aluminum base. It takes time !



## Tips
- There are dimensions to respect. When you add components to your robot, always keep the dimensions in mind! When you do your construction put yourself in mind a margin lower than allowed.
- Do not hesitate to use the scratch if it allows to be modular (example: ultrasound).
- One of the easiest ways to place your cards is to scratch them. Or else you can still fix them with plastic card holders.
- Keep in mind that you can place your cards against the walls of robots.
- When you think about the shape of the robot, think about the sensors and elements that will be on the walls.
- You can use the glue gun to place the cables or others!
- You have a 3D printer at your disposal. Do not hesitate to make support for elements that you will put on the robot such as servomotors for example.
- If you make floors to lay your cards, leave enough space between each floor so that your hand can easily enter for wiring (example: a cable that comes off a raspberry to reconnect).
- Try to make the beacon holder and ultrasounds modular. In case of problems with the approval, you can easily mount, dismount or change the position. It's important for homologation!
