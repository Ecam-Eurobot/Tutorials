# Vacuum prehention

To take the pucks, we use a vacuum system.

The material list:
- pump
- valve
- suction cup

The material is from Festo (we can have good price for student projetcs)

Other prehention systems were use to take the pucks of the 2019 contests: like shovel.

## Pros

* mechanism is easy to take flat surface

## Cons

* the pump use lot of power
* the pump and the valve take lot of space
